the three libs provided here are all compiled in release mode

they document the compression and decompression process with
various amounts of output to stdout

micode.lib - little bit of output

micode_more_logs.lib - lots (!) of output

micode_no_logs.lib - no output

otherwise they are identical. so you may compile with either
library.
